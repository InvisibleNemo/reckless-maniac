This is my first page of a personal project blog. I tried my hands on building a Jekyll website, but after numerous attempts, I found this tool to be one of the best.

I would be posting a tutorial on how to use this soon, for those who wish to host a website on their own. In later posts, I will delve deeper into how to configure and fine tune the looks of this website.
